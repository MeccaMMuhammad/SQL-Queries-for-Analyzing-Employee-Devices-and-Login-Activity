Task 1: Retrieve Employee Device Data
I retrieved the data from the machines table to get information on employee devices, including:

Device ID

Operating System

Email Client

OS Patch Date

-- Retrieve all information about employee devices
SELECT * FROM machines;

-- Retrieve only the device_id and email_client columns
SELECT device_id, email_client FROM machines;

-- Retrieve device_id, operating_system, and OS_patch_date columns
SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date FROM machines;

Task 2: Investigate Login Activity
I queried the log_in_attempts table to investigate login activity. The tasks included:

Checking login attempts from various countries (e.g., Australia)

Investigating login attempts outside working hours

Selecting all columns from the table using a wildcard (*)

-- Select event_id and country from log_in_attempts
SELECT event_id, country FROM log_in_attempts;

-- Check login attempts made outside of working hours
SELECT username, login_date, login_time FROM log_in_attempts;

-- Select all columns from the log_in_attempts table
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts;


Task 3: Order Data Using ORDER BY
I used the ORDER BY clause to sort the data based on login date and login time.

-- Order the data by login_date
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date;

-- Further organize the data by login_time
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date, login_time;

Key Takeaways:
SQL SELECT: I practiced using the SELECT statement to retrieve specific columns, or all columns using a wildcard (*).

Data Sorting: I utilized the ORDER BY keyword to sort data by date and time, which helps when analyzing time-sensitive data.

Data Investigation: The queries helped me investigate login activity patterns to spot potential security concerns, like login attempts from unusual locations or outside business hours.
